# <h1>NFS Game Navigator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a visual studio project that uses C# and XML to create an interactive menu that allows the user to select a game and it opens the game's folder. Since this was created for a friend, there was no security risk accessing their file explorer. I understand this typically would not be used in a professional setting and it was just a fun side project.
